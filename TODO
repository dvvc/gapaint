* TODO Save state when finished
  Serialize the current population in a text file, then add a flag to start
  from there

* TODO Add new candidates each iteration
  Currently the pool size stays the same at each iteration. An alternative
  would be to inject some new candidates at each step, so we have genSize +
  newCandidates. The less fit ones will go away in the tournament phase,
  anyway, but they should add diversity.

* TODO Optimize code
  There are some functions that can be optimized, such as dropAlpha and fitness
